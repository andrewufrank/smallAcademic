            <h1>Serving a homepage</h1>
    <p>Constructing a simple homepage, perhaps with a blog and some images is can be done in a few hours, possibly days with a tool like wordpress. To make something a bit more personal, satisfying some special requirements takes a bit of planning of content and how it can be served. In another <a href="">blog</a> I have presented my ideas for content of an academic homepage for a university researcher. Here, I want to address the techncal issues.</p><h2 id="separate-content-from-style">Separate content from style</h2><p>The data should be separated from the style of presentation, to - allow changes in the data without entanglement in the typically tricky descriptions of style, - changes in the style must be applied regularly on all content and should not require editing already existing data.</p><h2 id="avoid-databases-and-achieve-versioning-with-a-tool-like-git">Avoid databases and achieve versioning with a tool like Git</h2><p>In a the past, the dominant method for any but the simplest homepage was a content management system (CMS) which dynamically constructed webpages from content stored in a database system and rendered it with HTML.</p><p>Managing databases is complex, especially when the database is accessible in some form from the internet and thus exposed to the attacks of the hackers of the world. Database management systems are prepared for many situations and avail very complex approaches to multiple levels of security - typically difficult to learn and often in your way when you try to achieve something slightly out of the ordinary. Loading data into databases and unloading to move to a different system is typically difficult, due to the small, confusing differences between todays Relational DBMS.</p><p>Storing the data in text files, which can be edited by any of the well known text editors, is less expensive (in terms of acquisition and learning of programs) and moving data between systems is a breeze (or at least complexity is reduced to file transfer and conversion).</p><p>Editable text files must be supplemented with some form of version management and backupt system. Git is the (nearly) universal tool for this, widely available and familiar to most programmers.</p><h2 id="inexpensive-services-to-host-your-web-site">Inexpensive services to host your web site</h2><p>Services providing you with your own web address, some space to store your web site and seving it to users typing your web address in their browser can be constructed with open source software (e.g. cPanel), some standard hardware and a fast connection to the internet.</p><p>Important is to check that you are not committed to a specific host but use only services which are widely available, allowing you to move to another provide for any reason, technical, serivce or cost. You want to avoid all the traps, the providers set for you to obtain “essential” additional services, accumulated step by step each for a “small monthly fee”. The base services, i.e. all which is really “essential”, are availble for a Euro 2 .. 5 per month.</p><p>Generating your web site statically on you own hardware and upload the resulting files with an ftp trans (e.g. filezilla) is by far the least expensive solution.</p><h2 id="limitation-of-static-site-generation---complement-with-email">Limitation of Static Site Generation - complement with email</h2><p>A purely static site generation produces all web pages ahead of time; obviously interaction with your readers are excluded or must be achieved using other communicatin channels. For low traffic, personal webpages and blogs with few comments, email can be used by the readers to send you comment which you then post to the site for other readers to see togther with your answers. There exist software to streamline the process.</p><h2 id="interface">Interface</h2><p>Managing a small website requires tools for - editing content, usually a text editor and markdown language is sufficient. - backup and version management to keep your data secure; can be achieved with Git. - transfer of data from your computer to the host, with FTP and a tool like filezilla - rendering the data in style; best achieved with selecting one of the available “themes” available for your SSG engine.</p><h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1><p>Using one of the static site generators (SGG) together with some tools to backup and keeping versions of your site is likely all what is required. All the tools are available as Open-Source software. Popular is Jekyll, but modern (easier) systems like Hugo, which has a very structured, simple user interace (written in go) and Pelican (written in Python) using a standardized “Theme” language (Jinja2).</p><p>The necessary service to serve your content on a fast internet link is available together with your web address for less than Euro 5/month.</p><p>Check for: - static generatin of the site. - provider with ftp or ssh access for upload of data. - content written in markdown language.</p>
