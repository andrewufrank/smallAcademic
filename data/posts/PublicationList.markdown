# Principles for a researchers home page

A researchers homepage contains information which must be updated often; 
it reflects poorly on you if your homepage does not include the latest funding
you obtained, progress on research projects is missing and publications are not 
listed and not obtainable from your homepage (remember: publish in open-source
journals whenever possible, but even traditional journals allow you to post all 
but the final printed version on your homepage for others to download). 

It is therefore of utmost importance to make updating your homepage as simple as 
possible, means **ALL INFORMATION IS ENTERED AND MAINTAINED ONLY ONCE**. For publications, 
this is obviously your BibTex datafile, where you add your lates publication 
automatically, because you need to cite it in another publication (usually long 
before it actually appears in print). The publication list on you homepage must be 
automatically result from this list. 

The same goes for the CV - update it, whenever you have something to add or, at the
lastest, when you need to send it somewhere. The homepage can include several versions, 
responding to diffferent situations. 

In both cases, the solution assumed here is not yet perfect, but it is important 
to identify the target to work towards.
