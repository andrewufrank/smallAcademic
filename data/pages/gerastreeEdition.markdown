# Books published with Gerastree Edition

Print-on-demand is a method for scientists to claw-back some of the power publishers have accumulated through their control of the publishing process. It is possible with not much more effort than working with a normal publisher to produce much less expensive scientific books of comparable quality. I have produced so far a conference proceedings and a volume assembling papers on ontology previously published in several journals, each selling for about $7:

1. Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Corpus-Based Research in the Humanities CRH-2 (Geras Proceedings) (Volume 1)
1. Mountains, Men and Money – Ontology for Geographic and Spatio-Temporal Information Systems: Contesting Ontology by Engineering – Writings 1996-2007
