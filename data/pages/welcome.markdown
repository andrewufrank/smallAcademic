# An Example Homepage --- under construction

The example should show how to build an homepage for an academic researchers with Sprinkles, a simple web content server and static site generator written in Haskell. Sprinkles allows to use markdown, uses pandoc with which references in blogs and publication lists can be produced from a BibTex library, is designed wih safety in mind, free of spying software and ideally suited to be hosted on the least cost host (including github.io). 

The design starts with a list of information a homepage for an academic could include:

- chronological list of publications, as complete as possible and with links for download, and list of publications ordered by research topics (all automatically produced from BibTex files) with links to the publications
- drafts of papers for discussion
- a blog with smaller ideas and observations 
- a curriculum vitae of various levels of detail
- a contact addresses

The example documents (especially the blog) explains how this theme for sprinkles can be adapted to ones particular needs.

More details of the changes applied are described [here](logOfChanges).

To make things easier, the bottom of the page says which source file is used and which template was applied; this is not likely used in a final website.
