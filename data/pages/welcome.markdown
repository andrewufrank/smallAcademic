# Not My Homepage --- under construction

This is the start of a homepage to communicate  what I think a researcher's homepage should show.
It could show:

- chronological list of publications, as complete as possible and with links for download, and list of publications ordered by research topics (all automatically produced from BibTex files) with links to the publications
- drafts of papers for discussion
- a blog with smaller ideas and observations 
- a curriculum vitae of various levels of detail
- a contact addresses

The information included here as example explains at the same time, how this theme for sprinkles can be adapted.
More details of the changes applied are described [here](logOfChanges).
To make things easier, the bottom of the page says which source file is used and which template was applied; this is not likely used in a final website.
